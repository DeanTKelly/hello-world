# hello-world

Hello.

I'm Dean. I enjoy working with C# and various forms of SQL and continue to expand my repertoire. I am in the final course at school and upon completion will earn a B.S. in Software Development. I will begin by posting some projects I have completed during my academic journey. Then we'll see where things go from there.
